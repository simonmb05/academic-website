abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder involving
  chronic motor and phonic tics. Most individuals with TS can suppress their tics
  for at least a short period of time. Yet, the brain correlates of tic suppression
  are still poorly understood. METHODS: In the current study, high-density electroencephalography
  was recorded during a resting-state and a tic suppression session in 72 children
  with TS. Functional connectivity between cortical regions was assessed in the alpha
  band (8-13 Hz) using an electroencephalography source connectivity method. Graph
  theory and network-based statistics were used to assess the global network topology
  and to identify brain regions showing increased connectivity during tic suppression.
  RESULTS: Graph theoretical analyses revealed distinctive global network topology
  during tic suppression, relative to rest. Using network-based statistics, we found
  a subnetwork of increased connectivity during tic suppression (p textless .001).
  That subnetwork encompassed many cortical areas, including the right superior frontal
  gyrus and the left precuneus, which are involved in the default mode network. We
  also found a condition-by-age interaction, suggesting age-mediated increases in
  connectivity during tic suppression. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that children
  with TS suppress their tics through a brain circuit involving distributed cortical
  regions, many of which are part of the default mode network. Brain connectivity
  during tic suppression also increases as youths with TS mature. These results highlight
  a mechanism by which children with TS may control their tics, which could be relevant
  for future treatment studies.'
