abstract: Aggressive behavior is common across childhood-onset psychiatric disorders
  and is associated with impairments in social cognition and communication. The present
  study examined whether amygdala connectivity and reactivity during face emotion
  processing in children with maladaptive aggression are moderated by social impairment.
  This cross-sectional study included a well-characterized transdiagnostic sample
  of 101 children of age 8-16 years old with clinically significant levels of aggressive
  behavior and 32 typically developing children without aggressive behavior. Children
  completed a face emotion perception task of fearful and calm faces during functional
  magnetic resonance imaging. Aggressive behavior and social functioning were measured
  by standardized parent ratings. Relative to controls, children with aggressive behavior
  showed reduced connectivity between the amygdala and the dorsolateral prefrontal
  cortex (PFC) during implicit emotion processing. In children with aggressive behavior,
  the association between reduced amygdala-ventrolateral PFC connectivity and greater
  severity of aggression was moderated by greater social impairment. Amygdala reactivity
  to fearful faces was also associated with severity of aggressive behavior for children
  without social deficits but not for children with social deficits. Social impairments
  entail difficulties in interpreting social cues and enacting socially appropriate
  responses to frustration or provocation, which increase the propensity for an aggressive
  response via diminished connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral PFC.
