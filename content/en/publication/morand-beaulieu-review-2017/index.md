abstract: Neurocognitive functioning in Tourette syndrome (TS) has been the subject
  of intensive research in the past 30 years. A variety of impairments, presumably
  related to frontal and frontostriatal dysfunctions, have been observed. These impairments
  were found in various domains, such as attention, memory, executive functions, language,
  motor and visuomotor functions, among others. In line with contemporary research,
  other neurocognitive domains have recently been explored in TS, bringing evidence
  of altered social reasoning, for instance. Therefore, the aims of this review are
  to give an overview of the neuropsychological dimensions of TS, to report how neuropsychological
  functions evolve from childhood to adulthood, and to explain how various confounding
  factors can affect TS patients' performance in neuropsychological tasks. Finally,
  an important contribution of this review is to show how recent research has confirmed
  or changed our beliefs about neuropsychological functioning in TS.
