abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Tourette syndrome (TS) patients face various cognitive and
  motor impairments. Event-related potentials (ERP) constitute an effective way to
  investigate the neural correlates of those functional impairments. Various components
  have been assessed among TS patients, with a wide variety of paradigms. This systematic
  review aimed to evaluate the portrait of ERP components in TS patients, and to understand
  the factors leading to discrepancies across studies. METHODS: A literature search
  was performed in Embase, PsycINFO, Pubmed, and Web of Science, to identify studies
  that conducted ERP experiments among TS patients. Of the 372 unique records identified,
  47 met inclusion criteria and were included in our systematic review. RESULTS: Various
  ERP particularities were reported among included studies. Many discrepancies exist,
  but impairments in motor-related potentials and contingent negative variation seem
  constant across studies. Divergent findings point toward a possibly reduced P3b
  during oddball tasks. CONCLUSIONS: ERPs offer an insightful investigation into the
  cognitive and motor functions of TS patients. Future studies should always control
  for confounding factors such as comorbidity, age, or medication status. SIGNIFICANCE:
  This is the first systematic review of ERP in TS patients. Motor-related and slow
  cortical potentials could constitute electrophysiological markers of TS.'
