abstract: Observational fear learning can contribute to the development of fear-related
  psychopathologies, such as anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder.
  Observational fear learning is especially relevant during childhood. Parent-child
  attachment and anxiety sensitivity modulate fear reactions and fear learning but
  their impact on observational fear learning has not been investigated. This study
  investigated how these factors contribute to observational fear learning in children.
  We examined this question among 55 healthy parent-child dyads. Children (8-12 years
  old) watched a video of their parent undergoing a direct fear conditioning protocol,
  where one stimulus (CS+Parent) was paired with a shock and one was not (CS-), and
  a video of a stranger for whom a different stimulus was reinforced (CS+Stranger).
  Subsequently, all stimuli were presented to children (without shocks) while skin
  conductance responses were recorded to evaluate fear levels. Our results showed
  that children more sensitive to anxiety and who had lower father-child relationship
  security levels exhibited higher skin conductance responses to the CS+Parent. Our
  data suggest that the father-child relationship security influences vicarious fear
  transmission in children who are more sensitive to anxiety. This highlights the
  importance of the father-child relationship security as a potential modulator of
  children's vulnerability to fear-related psychopathologies.
