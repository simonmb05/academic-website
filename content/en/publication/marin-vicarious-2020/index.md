abstract: The biological mechanisms involved in fear transmission within families
  have been scarcely investigated in humans. Here we studied (1) how children acquired
  conditioned fear from observing their parent, or a stranger, being exposed to a
  fear conditioning paradigm, and (2) the subsequent fear extinction process in these
  children. Eighty-three child-parent dyads were recruited. The parent was filmed
  while undergoing a conditioning procedure where one cue was paired with a shock
  (CS + Parent) and one was not (CS -). Children (8 to 12 years old) watched this
  video and a video of an adult stranger who underwent conditioning with a different
  cue reinforced (CS + Stranger). Children were then exposed to all cues (no shocks
  were delivered) while skin conductance responses (SCR) were recorded. Children exhibited
  higher SCR to the CS + Parent and CS + Stranger relative to the CS -. Physiological
  synchronization between the child's SCR during observational learning and the parent's
  SCR during the actual process of fear conditioning predicted higher SCR for the
  child to the CS + Parent. Our data suggest that children acquire fear vicariously
  and this can be measured physiologically. These data lay the foundation to examine
  observational fear learning mechanisms that might contribute to fear and anxiety
  disorders transmission in clinically affected families.
