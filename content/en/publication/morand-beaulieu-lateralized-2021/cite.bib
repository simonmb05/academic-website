 abstract = {Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients are known to have various functional abnormalities in prefrontal and motor areas. Given the presence of compulsions in many OCD patients, impaired response preparation processes could be a core feature of OCD. Yet, these processes remain understudied from a neurophysiological standpoint. Nineteen OCD patients were matched on age and sex to 19 healthy controls. Continuous EEG was recorded in all participants during a stimulus-response compatibility task. EEG from electrodes C3 and C4 was then averaged into stimulus- and response-locked LRPs. We compared both groups on various LRP measures, such as the LRP onset, the Gratton dip, and the maximum LRP peak. OCD patients showed significantly larger LRP peak than healthy controls, as well as larger Gratton dip. However, there was no group difference regarding LRP onset. Among OCD patients, it seems that motor regions are overactive during response preparation. Such overactivity was found for both incorrect responses that are aborted before execution and responses that are truly executed. These results suggest that regulation of sensorimotor activity should be addressed in the treatment of OCD.},
