abstract: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients are known to have various functional
  abnormalities in prefrontal and motor areas. Given the presence of compulsions in
  many OCD patients, impaired response preparation processes could be a core feature
  of OCD. Yet, these processes remain understudied from a neurophysiological standpoint.
  Nineteen OCD patients were matched on age and sex to 19 healthy controls. Continuous
  EEG was recorded in all participants during a stimulus-response compatibility task.
  EEG from electrodes C3 and C4 was then averaged into stimulus- and response-locked
  LRPs. We compared both groups on various LRP measures, such as the LRP onset, the
  Gratton dip, and the maximum LRP peak. OCD patients showed significantly larger
  LRP peak than healthy controls, as well as larger Gratton dip. However, there was
  no group difference regarding LRP onset. Among OCD patients, it seems that motor
  regions are overactive during response preparation. Such overactivity was found
  for both incorrect responses that are aborted before execution and responses that
  are truly executed. These results suggest that regulation of sensorimotor activity
  should be addressed in the treatment of OCD.
