abstract: Tic disorders (TD) and body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRB) have similar
  phenotypes that can be challenging to distinguish in clinical settings. Both disorders
  show high rates of comorbid psychiatric conditions, dysfunctional basal ganglia
  activity, atypical cortical functioning in the prefrontal and motor cortical regions,
  and cognitive deficits. Clinicians frequently confound the two disorders and it
  is important to find reliable objective methods to discriminate TD and BFRB. Neuropsychological
  tests and event-related potential (ERP) studies have yielded inconsistent results
  regarding a possible context updating deficit in TD and BFRB patients. However,
  most previous studies did not control for the presence of comorbid psychiatric condition
  and medication status, which might have confounded the findings reported to date.
  Hence, we aimed to investigate the psychophysiology of working memory using ERP
  in carefully screened TD and BFRB patients excluding those with psychiatric comorbidity
  and those taking psychoactive medication. The current study compared 12 TD patients,
  12 BRFB patients, and 15 healthy control participants using a motor oddball task
  (button press). The P300 component was analyzed as an index of working memory functioning.
  Results showed that BFRB patients had decreased P300 oddball effect amplitudes over
  the right hemisphere compared to the TD and control groups. Clinical groups presented
  different scalp distributions compared to controls, which could represent a potential
  endophenotype candidate of BFRB and TD.
