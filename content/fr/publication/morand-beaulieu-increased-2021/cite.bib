 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder involving chronic motor and phonic tics. Most individuals with TS can suppress their tics for at least a short period of time. Yet, the brain correlates of tic suppression are still poorly understood. METHODS: In the current study, high-density electroencephalography was recorded during a resting-state and a tic suppression session in 72 children with TS. Functional connectivity between cortical regions was assessed in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) using an electroencephalography source connectivity method. Graph theory and network-based statistics were used to assess the global network topology and to identify brain regions showing increased connectivity during tic suppression. RESULTS: Graph theoretical analyses revealed distinctive global network topology during tic suppression, relative to rest. Using network-based statistics, we found a subnetwork of increased connectivity during tic suppression (p \textless .001). That subnetwork encompassed many cortical areas, including the right superior frontal gyrus and the left precuneus, which are involved in the default mode network. We also found a condition-by-age interaction, suggesting age-mediated increases in connectivity during tic suppression. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that children with TS suppress their tics through a brain circuit involving distributed cortical regions, many of which are part of the default mode network. Brain connectivity during tic suppression also increases as youths with TS mature. These results highlight a mechanism by which children with TS may control their tics, which could be relevant for future treatment studies.},
