abstract: "BACKGROUND: Tic disorders, such as the Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and\
  \ persistent tic disorder, are neurodevelopmental movement disorders involving impaired\
  \ motor control. Hence, patients show repetitive unwanted muscular contractions\
  \ in one or more parts of the body. A cognitive-behavioral therapy, with a particular\
  \ emphasis on the psychophysiology of tic expression and sensorimotor activation,\
  \ can reduce the frequency and intensity of tics. However, its impact on motor activation\
  \ and inhibition is not fully understood. METHODS: To study the effects of a cognitive-behavioral\
  \ therapy on electrocortical activation, we recorded the event-related potentials\
  \ (ERP) and lateralized readiness potentials (LRP), before and after treatment,\
  \ of 20 patients with tic disorders and 20 healthy control participants (matched\
  \ on age, sex and intelligence), during a stimulus-response compatibility inhibition\
  \ task. The cognitive-behavioral therapy included informational, awareness training,\
  \ relaxation, muscle discrimination, cognitive restructuration and relapse prevention\
  \ strategies. RESULTS: Our results revealed that prior to treatment; tic patients\
  \ had delayed stimulus-locked LRP onset latency, larger response-locked LRP peak\
  \ amplitude, and a frontal overactivation during stimulus inhibition processing.\
  \ Both stimulus-locked LRP onset latency and response-locked LRP peak amplitude\
  \ normalized after the cognitive behavioral therapy completion. However, the frontal\
  \ overactivation related to inhibition remained unchanged following therapy. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ Our results showed that P300 and reaction times are sensitive to stimulus-response\
  \ compatibility, but are not related to tic symptoms. Secondly, overactivity of\
  \ the frontal LPC and impulsivity in TD patients were not affected by treatment.\
  \ Finally, CBT had normalizing effects on the activation of the pre-motor and motor\
  \ cortex in TD patients. These results imply specific modifications of motor processes\
  \ following therapy, while inhibition processes remained unchanged. Given that LRPs\
  \ are partially generated within the sensorimotor and supplementary motor area,\
  \ the reported reduction in tic frequency and improvements of LRPs components suggest\
  \ that CBT induced a physiological change in patients' motor area."
