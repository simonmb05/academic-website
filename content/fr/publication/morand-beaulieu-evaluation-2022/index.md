abstract: Objective Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) is a first-line
  treatment of Tourette syndrome (TS). However, the brain mechanisms involved in CBIT
  are poorly understood. Enhanced frontomesial EEG coherence during a Go/NoGo task
  has been suggested as a mechanism involved in voluntary tic control. In the current
  study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess whether EEG coherence
  during a Go/NoGo task was associated with CBIT outcome. Methods Thirty-two children
  with TS were randomly assigned to CBIT or to treatment-as-usual (TAU). Treatment
  outcome was assessed by a blinded evaluator with the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale
  (YGTSS) and the Clinical Global Impression â€“ Improvement Scale (CGI-I). EEG was
  recorded during a Go/NoGo task at baseline and endpoint. EEG coherence was computed
  in the alpha frequency band between a priori selected channel pairs spanning the
  frontal and motor areas. Results Tic severity decreased significantly in the CBIT
  group. However, CBIT did not impact EEG coherence and baseline EEG coherence did
  not predict treatment outcome. Conclusions Although CBIT was superior to TAU on
  blinded clinical outcomes, EEG coherence during the Go/NoGo task was not associated
  with change in tic severity. Significance The brain processes involved in the inhibition
  of motor responses do not appear to be involved in CBIT.
