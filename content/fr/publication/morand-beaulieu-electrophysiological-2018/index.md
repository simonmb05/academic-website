abstract: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) constitutes an empirically based treatment
  for tic disorders (TD), but much remains to be learned about its impact at the neural
  level. Therefore, we examined the electrophysiological correlates of CBT in TD patients,
  and we evaluated the utility of event-related potentials (ERP) as predictors of
  CBT outcome. ERPs were recorded during a stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) task
  in 26 TD patients and 26 healthy controls. Recordings were performed twice, before
  and after CBT in TD patients, and with a similar time interval in healthy controls.
  The stimulus- and response-locked lateralized readiness potentials (sLRP & rLRP)
  were assessed, as well as the N200 and the P300. The results revealed that before
  CBT, TD patients showed a delayed sLRP onset and larger amplitude of both the sLRP
  and rLRP peaks, in comparison with healthy controls. The CBT induced an acceleration
  of the sLRP onset and a reduction of the rLRP peak amplitude. Compared to healthy
  controls, TD patients showed a more frontal distribution of the No-Go P300, which
  was however not affected by CBT. Finally, a multiple linear regression analysis
  including the N200 and the incompatible sLRP onset corroborated a predictive model
  of therapeutic outcome, which explained 43% of the variance in tic reduction following
  CBT. The current study provided evidence that CBT can selectively normalize motor
  processes relative to stimulus-response compatibility in TD patients. Also, ERPs
  can predict the amount of tic symptoms improvement induced by the CBT and might
  therefore improve treatment modality allocation among TD patients.
