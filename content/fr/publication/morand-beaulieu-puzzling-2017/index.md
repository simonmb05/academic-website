abstract: Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder involving motor and
  phonic tics. Inhibitory control is a key issue in TS, and many disruptive or impulsive
  behaviors might arise from inhibitory deficits. However, conflicting findings regarding
  TS patients' inhibitory performance in neuropsychological tasks have been reported
  throughout the literature. Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to evaluate inhibitory
  control through neuropsychological tasks, and to analyze the factors modulating
  inhibitory deficits. To this end, a literature search was performed through MEDLINE
  and PsycINFO, to retrieve studies including neuropsychological tasks that assessed
  inhibitory control in TS patients. Of the 4020 studies identified, 61 were included
  in the meta-analysis, for a total of 1717 TS patients. Our analyses revealed a small
  to medium effect in favor of inhibitory deficits in TS patients. This effect was
  larger in TS+ADHD patients, but pure TS patients also showed some inhibitory deficits.
  Therefore, deficits in inhibitory control seem to be an inherent component of TS,
  and are exacerbated when ADHD is concomitant.
