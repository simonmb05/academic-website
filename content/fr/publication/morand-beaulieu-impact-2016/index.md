abstract: "CONTEXT: Tic disorders (TD) are characterized by the presence of non-voluntary\
  \ contractions of functionally related groups of skeletal muscles in one or multiple\
  \ body parts. Patients with body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRB) present frequent\
  \ and repetitive behaviors, such as nail biting or hair pulling. TD and BFRB can\
  \ be treated with a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that regulates the excessive\
  \ amount of sensorimotor activation and muscular tension. Our CBT, which is called\
  \ the cognitive-psychophysiological (CoPs) model, targets motor execution and inhibition,\
  \ and it was reported to modify brain activity in TD. However, psychophysiological\
  \ effects of therapy are still poorly understood in TD and BFRB patients. Our goals\
  \ were to compare the event-related potentials (ERP) of TD and BFRB patients to\
  \ control participants and to investigate the effects of the CoPs therapy on the\
  \ P200, N200, and P300 components during a motor and a non-motor oddball task. METHOD:\
  \ Event-related potential components were compared in 26 TD patients, 27 BFRB patients,\
  \ and 27 control participants. ERP were obtained from 63 EEG electrodes during two\
  \ oddball tasks. In the non-motor task, participants had to count rare stimuli.\
  \ In the motor task, participants had to respond with a left and right button press\
  \ for rare and frequent stimuli, respectively. ERP measures were recorded before\
  \ and after therapy in both patient groups. RESULTS: CoPs therapy improved symptoms\
  \ similarly in both clinical groups. Before therapy, TD and BFRB patients had reduced\
  \ P300 oddball effect during the non-motor task, in comparison with controls participants.\
  \ An increase in the P300 oddball effect was observed posttherapy. This increase\
  \ was distributed over the whole cortex in BFRB patients, but localized in the parietal\
  \ area in TD patients. DISCUSSION: These results suggest a modification of neural\
  \ processes following CoPs therapy in TD and BFRB patients. CoPs therapy seems to\
  \ impact patients' attentional processes and context updating capacities in working\
  \ memory (i.e., P300 component). Our results are consistent with a possible role\
  \ of the prefrontal cortex and corpus callosum in mediating interhemispheric interference\
  \ in TD."
